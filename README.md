# K-Bot


Final project for the *Human Machine Dialogue* course at University of Trento (M.Sc. Artificial Intelligence Systems).

## Description

K-Bot is an assistant that can help any user find K-Pop songs that align with their taste, and/or retrieve useful and interesting information about various K-Pop groups.
